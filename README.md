### *Lasagna are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagna, or the singular lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of this flat pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. This lasagna is all kinds of amazing. And it tastes great out of the oven when it’s warm and bubbly. But an even better thing with this lasagna is that it tastes even better the next day when the layers have had more time to sit together. And if you freeze it and reheat it a month later, it still tastes fantastic! So all I’m saying is, it’s time to make yourself a nice big batch of vegetarian lasagna…right away.*
