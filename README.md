### *Lasagna are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagna, or the singular lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of this flat pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. This lasagna is all kinds of amazing. And it tastes great out of the oven when it’s warm and bubbly. But an even better thing with this lasagna is that it tastes even better the next day when the layers have had more time to sit together. And if you freeze it and reheat it a month later, it still tastes fantastic! So all I’m saying is, it’s time to make yourself a nice big batch of vegetarian lasagna…right away.* 

1. Veggies(any veggie goes great with lasagna, it's your choice)

2. combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. (The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.)

3. cheeses(it's your choice, We’re using ricotta, shredded mozzarella and parmesan, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great

flavor.)

4. Spinach and Ricotta filling

5. Lasagna sheets

layers in this lasagna

There are three main layers in this lasagna – spinach ricotta which adds a layer of creaminess, pan roasted vegetables, cheese and sauce.

You will need to make three main elements for this recipe, and these can be made ahead, so that all you finally have to do is assemble and bake.
vegetables in this lasagna


I’ve used the vegetables that I think go best in a lasagna – red bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini. The easiest and fastest way to prepare them is by pan roasting them in some oil with onions and garlic. But you can also roast them in the oven.

We also have spinach in the recipe that goes in the spinach ricotta layer. So you really have a ton of veggies that go here!

I always use the no cook lasagna sheets. The advantage with them is that you don’t need to pre-boil them before using them. They are much easier to handle and cook as the lasagna cooks. You can also use fresh lasagna sheets if you can get your hands on them.

HOW TO FREEZE AND REHEAT LASAGNA
You can also freeze the lasagna either baked or unbaked.
To freeze an unbaked lasagna: Line the pan with foil before assembling, then assemble the lasagna as directly. Let cool completely, and then freeze until solid. Once frozen, lift the frozen lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil, then freeze for up to a month.

To reheat an unbaked frozen lasagna: Remove the lasagna from the freezer and unwrap all the layers of foil. Transfer to the original casserole dish, cover, and let it thaw in the fridge overnight. Once thawed, bake as directed.
