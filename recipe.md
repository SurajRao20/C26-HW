## ***layers in this lasagna***

##### There are three main layers in this lasagna – **spinach ricotta which adds a layer of creaminess, pan roasted vegetables, cheese and sauce**. You will need to make three main elements for this recipe, and these can be made ahead, so that all you finally have to do is assemble and bake.

## ***vegetables in this lasagna***

##### *I’ve used the vegetables that I think go best in a lasagna – r**ed bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini**. The easiest and fastest way to prepare them is by pan roasting them in some oil with onions and garlic. But you can also roast them in the oven. We also have **spinach** in the recipe that goes in the spinach ricotta layer. So you really have a ton of veggies that go here!*

## *the pasta in this lasagna*

##### *I always use the no cook lasagna sheets. The advantage with them is that you don’t need to pre-boil them before using them. They are much easier to handle and cook as the lasagna cooks. You can also use fresh lasagna sheets if you can get your hands on them.*

## *HOW TO FREEZE AND REHEAT LASAGNA*

### *You can also freeze the lasagna either baked or unbaked.*

- ### *To freeze an unbaked lasagna: Line the pan with foil before assembling, then assemble the lasagna as directly. Let cool completely, and then freeze until solid. Once frozen, lift the frozen lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil, then freeze for up to a month.*

- ### *To reheat an unbaked frozen lasagna: Remove the lasagna from the freezer and unwrap all the layers of foil. Transfer to the original casserole dish, cover, and let it thaw in the fridge overnight. Once thawed, bake as directed.*

Combine them in a freezer storage bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the fridge. To reheat, unwrap from the foil, place on a microwave-safe dish, and reheat in the*
